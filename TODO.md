# S3 Upload Fix TODO

## Backend Changes
- [x] Sanitize claimId in s3_key_for_claim_file to replace slashes with underscores
- [x] Improve error logging in upload_file_to_s3 for better debugging

## Frontend Changes
- [x] Validate claimId in MultiStepForm before upload and log it
- [x] Add validation in s3API.uploadFile to prevent invalid claimId usage

## Testing
- [ ] Test uploading from frontend with claimId containing slashes
- [ ] Verify 500 error is resolved
- [ ] Check backend logs for any remaining issues
