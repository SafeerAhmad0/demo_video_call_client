# JWT Removal Progress Tracking

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Remove JWT token handling from MeetingPage.tsx
- [x] Remove JWT parameter from Dashboard.tsx navigation
- [x] Verify JitsiMeeting component handles undefined jwt properly
- [x] Update TODO_JWT_REMOVAL.md documentation

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Test video call creation from Dashboard
4. Test joining meetings without authentication
5. Test MultiStepForm workflow
6. Verify both doctor and patient can join without "waiting for moderator"

## Testing Commands:
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend && python main.py

# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm start
```

## Expected Behavior:
- Video calls should be created successfully without JWT tokens
- Both doctor and patient should be able to join meetings immediately
- No "waiting for moderator" messages should appear
- SMS messages should be sent correctly without JWT tokens
