# Video Call Authentication Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem: Users see "waiting for moderator" when joining Jitsi calls
- Backend generates URLs with wrong domain fallback
- Local Jitsi instance requires authentication but public instance doesn't
- Domain mismatch between frontend and backend

## Solution: Use public Jitsi Meet instance (meet.jit.si) without authentication

### Steps Completed:
- [x] Fixed backend meetings.py domain fallback (both functions)
- [x] Added HTTPS protocol for public Jitsi URLs
- [x] Removed all references to localhost:8000 in meeting URL generation

### Files Modified:
- backend/app/api/routers/meetings.py - Fixed domain fallback to use "meet.jit.si"
- backend/app/api/routers/meetings.py - Added HTTPS protocol for public Jitsi URLs

### Next Steps:
1. Restart backend service to apply changes
2. Test video call generation and joining
3. Verify SMS links point to correct public Jitsi URLs (https://meet.jit.si/room-name)
4. Confirm both doctor and patient can join without authentication

### Testing Required:
- Generate meeting links through MultiStepForm
- Verify doctor can join via the doctor link
- Verify patient can join via SMS link
- Confirm no "waiting for moderator" message appears
